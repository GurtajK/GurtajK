- My name is Gurtaj Khabra and I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering course.
- This is my second year in university but because of Covid-19 my first year was realtively unexciting.
- In my current semester I am learning more concepts related to working with c/c++ which I only knew to a limited level before.
- I also have a basic understanding of Visual Basic and java (jcreator and eclipse) from high school.
- The language I am currently most familiar with is Python because it was the focus of my computer course last semester.
- Collborating on various side projects is something I look forward to doing alongside working my coop terms.
