- My name is Gurtaj Khabra and I'm a 4th year software engineering co-op student at the University of Alberta.
- Currently, I'm most comfortable with C#, SQL, and Vue3 with Javascript since that was the primary focus of my last work term.
- Other languages with which I'm familiar include Python, Java, and C++.
- I look forward to working on various side projects and collaborating with others as I explore various niches in the industry.
- One of the areas I most look forward to exploring is augmented reality. I have not stepped into this area much but hope to do so in the future.
