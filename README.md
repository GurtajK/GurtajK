- My name is Gurtaj Khabra and I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering course.
- This is my second year in university but because of Covid-19 my first year was realtively unexciting.
- I have some basic knowledge of C/C++ because I was interested in learning it.
- I also have a basic understanding of Visual Basic and java (jcreator and eclipse) from high school.
- This year in university, I am currently learning Python and will be learning more c/c++ next semester.
- Collborating on random side projects is something I look forward to doing alongside working my coop terms.
