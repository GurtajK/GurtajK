- My name is Gurtaj Khabra and I'm a software engineering student currently in the third year of my degree.
- Currently, I'm learning javascript and react while volunteering at UofA Blueprint as well as Java through an OOP course.
- Other languages with which I'm familiar are Python, C++, and C#.
- I look forward to working on various side projects and collaborating with others as I learn the ins and outs of this field.
